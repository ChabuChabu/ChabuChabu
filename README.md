## Solutions Engineer | SaaS Integrations | API Debugging | Data Investigation

I’m a technical professional transitioning toward **Solutions Engineering** and **SaaS Integration / Solution Architecture**.

My background is in **API troubleshooting**, **technical escalations**, and **data investigation** within SaaS environments. I work across engineering, product, and customer-facing teams to diagnose complex issues, validate system behaviour, and drive resolution—especially where problems span **APIs, data pipelines, and configuration**.

I’m currently upskilling in **backend engineering** and **cloud fundamentals** to strengthen my ability to design and deliver scalable integration solutions.

---

## 🧩 Technical Experience Highlights

- **API troubleshooting & integration support**
  - Investigated issues across REST-style endpoints (requests/responses, status codes, payload structure)
  - Reproduced customer issues, isolated variables, and documented steps for engineering handoff
  - Validated behaviour using logs, request traces, and environment comparisons

- **Data discrepancy investigation (SQL-driven)**
  - Queried and reconciled datasets to identify mismatches across sources of truth
  - Performed root-cause analysis for reporting/analytics inconsistencies
  - Communicated findings clearly with supporting evidence and remediation options

- **Escalation ownership & cross-functional delivery**
  - Managed technical escalations end-to-end: triage → investigation → resolution → prevention
  - Translated ambiguous symptoms into actionable engineering hypotheses
  - Produced structured updates, timelines, and impact summaries for stakeholders

- **SaaS configuration & environment-level troubleshooting**
  - Supported integration workflows affected by configuration, permissions, or deployment differences
  - Identified failure points across system boundaries (client setup vs platform behaviour)

---

## 🔍 Core Strengths

- Debugging mindset: **hypothesis → isolate → validate → document**
- Strong foundations in **HTTP + API integration patterns**
- SQL-based investigation for **data correctness and reconciliation**
- Clear technical communication across customers, support, and engineering teams
- Ownership under pressure (prioritisation, escalation management, stakeholder updates)

---

## 📚 Current Upskilling Focus

To move into Solutions Engineer / Integration / Solutions Architect roles, I’m actively building depth in:

- **Backend development (Python)**
  - Designing clean APIs, request validation, error handling
  - Testing fundamentals and maintainable code structure

- **Integration patterns**
  - Webhooks, event-driven workflows, retries, idempotency
  - Authentication concepts: API keys, JWT, OAuth2 fundamentals

- **Cloud & delivery fundamentals**
  - IAM concepts, networking basics, deployment workflows
  - Observability: logs/metrics basics and practical troubleshooting patterns

- **Architecture thinking**
  - Tradeoffs, failure modes, reliability patterns, clear documentation

---

## 🎯 Career Direction

I’m working toward roles such as:

- **Solutions Engineer**
- **SaaS Integration Engineer**
- **Solutions Architect**

My goal is to design and deliver integration architectures that are **secure, reliable, and scalable**, while bridging customer requirements with engineering realities.

---

## 🛠 Areas of Growing Technical Depth

- REST APIs, webhook workflows, event processing concepts
- Auth & identity fundamentals (OAuth concepts, JWT)
- SQL investigation and data validation
- Cloud infrastructure fundamentals (networking, IAM, deployment)
- System design fundamentals and reliability patterns

---

I’m documenting my learning journey and building integration-focused projects to develop stronger architectural and delivery capabilities.
